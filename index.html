      <p>When you call 911, you’re not just asking for help — you’re counting on it to arrive fast. In a city as massive and complex as New York, with over 8 million people across five diverse boroughs, response time can depend on where you are, what happened, and who’s available to respond.</p>
      <p>Sometimes it’s an EMS crew rushing to a medical emergency. Other times, it’s a firetruck racing toward smoke or flames. And often, it’s both — arriving at the same scene to provide rescue and critical care together. But how often do EMS and Fire actually respond side by side? Which neighborhoods get faster, more coordinated responses? What types of emergencies draw both services? Are there patterns in injury severity, incident type, or geographic location that shape these responses?</p>
      <p>These are big questions, but they’re exactly what this project sets out to explore. We’ve analyzed millions of 911 dispatch records spanning several years to understand how emergency response unfolds across NYC. By combining EMS and Fire data and mapping where and when joint responses occur — or don’t — we’re shedding light on how the city reacts during its most critical moments.</p>
      <p>Yet this story isn’t just about sirens and flashing lights. It’s about equity, preparedness, and how public resources are distributed. It’s about whether your ZIP code affects how quickly help arrives. And it’s about giving everyday New Yorkers the tools to see what’s happening in their neighborhoods.</p>
      <p>Even if you don’t live in New York City, this story matters. Emergency response systems are everywhere — and the challenges they face are often strikingly similar. By examining how one of the world’s busiest urban centers handles its emergencies, we can all learn something about how to strengthen the systems that protect us. Our goal is simple: to inform, engage, and maybe even inspire change. Because the better we understand the patterns behind emergencies, the better we can prepare for the next one.</p>

     <h2>Tracing the Pulse of Emergencies: Total Incidents Over Time</h2>
      <p>To understand how emergency response flows across New York City, we begin with the big picture: the sheer volume of incidents recorded over time. Every day, thousands of 911 calls pour in — each representing an urgent moment in someone’s life.</p>
      <p>Our first visualization captures the rhythm of these emergencies, revealing how call volume shifts across months and years. Are there seasonal surges? Do certain times of year consistently strain the system? Are external factors — like heatwaves, holidays, or large-scale events — influencing the data?</p>

      <h2>Mapping the Pulse: Hotspots and Trends Across ZIP Codes</h2>
      <p>From time to time, it's not just when emergencies happen that matters — it’s where. Our next step zooms into the ZIP code level, providing a granular map of incident density across the city.</p>
      <iframe src="pages/nyc_incidents_zip_map.html"></iframe>
      <p>Here, each ZIP code is represented by color-coded, size-adjustable markers, showing the intensity and volume of EMS and Fire calls. Darker shades and larger markers highlight neighborhoods with higher emergency loads.</p>
      <p>The map offers more than just a count, it also reveals the types of emergencies occurring in different areas.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>EMS Incidents:</strong> Are more common in areas with dense populations or specific health vulnerabilities.</li>
        <li><strong>Fire (Medical):</strong> May correlate with older buildings, complex construction, or housing with limited safety infrastructure.</li>
        <li><strong>Fire (Non-Medical):</strong> Often point to risks around maintenance, fire prevention, or structural safety.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>By layering incident type onto geography, we begin to ask deeper questions: Do the same ZIP codes show up across categories? Are these emergencies linked to social, economic, or environmental conditions?</p>

    <section id="incidents_pp">
      <h2>Zooming In: EMS and Fire Response by Precinct</h2>
      <p>While ZIP codes provide a neighborhood view, precinct-level analysis brings us even closer to operational realities. Police precincts — often used as administrative and deployment zones — reveal how emergency services are actually performing on the ground.</p>
      <iframe src="pages/bokeh_ems_precincts.html"></iframe>
      <iframe src="pages/bokeh_fire_precincts.html"></iframe>
      <p>Each of the interactive plots highlights critical insights about emergency response patterns by precinct. Each bar shows the total number of incidents for either EMS or Fire services. The orange line represents the average response time in seconds.</p>
      <p>Use the interactive features to explore individual boroughs and dive into specific police precincts by selecting only a few of them. You’ll be able to see how incident volume and response times vary across neighborhoods, often revealing surprising contrasts.</p>

    <section id="severity">
      <h2>How Serious Are NYC Emergencies? A Closer Look at Severity Levels</h2>
      <p>Not all emergencies are created equal. Some are minor — a dizzy spell, a cut, a routine health issue. Others are life-threatening, with seconds making the difference between survival and loss.</p>
      <p>To better understand what first responders face, we categorized incidents by severity: Low, Moderate, High, or Extreme.</p>
      <div class="zoom-container">
        <img src="static/severity.png" alt="severity"/>
      <p>EMS, in particular, carries the brunt of the city's emergency load. From minor injuries to life-threatening cardiac arrests and trauma cases, the sheer volume handled by EMS is not just immense — it’s relentless.</p>
      <p>Fire Department responses are fewer in number but show a concerning trend. Too many of them are in the Extreme severity level — catastrophic events that demand immediate, high-stakes coordination across multiple agencies.</p>
