      <h1>Exploring NYC's Emergency Response</h1>
      <p>When you call 911, you’re not just asking for help — you’re counting on it to arrive fast. In a city as massive and complex as New York, with over 8 million people across five diverse boroughs, response time can depend on where you are, what happened, and who’s available to respond.</p>
      <p>Sometimes it’s an EMS crew rushing to a medical emergency. Other times, it’s a firetruck racing toward smoke or flames. And often, it’s both — arriving at the same scene to provide rescue and critical care together. But how often do EMS and Fire actually respond side by side? Which neighborhoods get faster, more coordinated responses? What types of emergencies draw both services? Are there patterns in injury severity, incident type, or geographic location that shape these responses?</p>
      <p>These are big questions, but they’re exactly what this project sets out to explore. We’ve analyzed millions of 911 dispatch records spanning several years to understand how emergency response unfolds across NYC. By combining EMS and Fire data and mapping where and when joint responses occur — or don’t — we’re shedding light on how the city reacts during its most critical moments.</p>
      <p>This story goes beyond sirens and flashing lights. It’s about equity, emergency readiness, and how public resources are allocated. It asks whether your ZIP code influences how quickly help arrives—and aims to empower everyday New Yorkers with the tools to understand what’s happening in their own neighborhoods <p>
      <p>Even if you don’t live in New York City, this story matters. Emergency response systems are everywhere — and the challenges they face are often strikingly similar. By examining how one of the world’s busiest urban centers handles its emergencies, we can all learn something about how to strengthen the systems that protect us. Our goal is simple. We want to inform, engage, and maybe even inspire change. Because the better we understand the patterns behind emergencies, the better we can prepare for the next one.</p>

     <h2>Tracing the Pulse of Emergencies: Total Incidents Over Time</h2>
      <p>To understand how emergency response flows across New York City, we begin with the big picture: the sheer volume of incidents recorded over time. Every day, thousands of 911 calls pour in — each representing an urgent moment in someone’s life.</p>
      <div class="zoom-container">
        <img src="static/time_barchart.png" alt="time_barchart"/>
      <p>Our first visualization captures the rhythm of these emergencies, revealing how call volume shifts across months and years. Are there seasonal surges? Do certain times of year consistently strain the system? Are external factors — like heatwaves, holidays, or large-scale events — influencing the data?</p>
      <p>Even this simple bar plot reveals valuable insights—It’s a straightforward visualization, but surprisingly powerful.</p>

      <h2>Mapping the Pulse: Hotspots and Trends Across ZIP Codes</h2>
      <p>From time to time, it's not just when emergencies happen that matters — it’s where. Our next step zooms into the ZIP code level, providing a granular map of incident density across the city.</p>
      <iframe src="pages/nyc_incidents_zip_map.html"></iframe>
      <p><strong>Let’s break down what you’re seeing!<strong><p>
      <p>The map displays all five boroughs, each divided into ZIP codes and color-coded for easy navigation. Within each ZIP code, you'll notice colored markers that indicate the intensity and volume of EMS and Fire calls—ranging from small green dots in lower-incident areas to large red dots in neighborhoods with frequent emergencies. These visual cues highlight areas with higher emergency loads.</p>
      <p>But the map goes beyond just counting calls—it reveals the types of emergencies happening in each area. Click on any marker to see specific details about the incidents.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>EMS Incidents </strong> tend to be more frequent in densely populated areas or communities with specific health challenges.</li>
        <li><strong>Fire (Medical)</strong> responses may be linked to older buildings, dense construction, or housing with limited safety infrastructure.</li>
        <li><strong>Fire (Non-Medical)</strong>  calls often reflect risks related to property maintenance, fire prevention practices, or structural safety issues.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>By layering incident type onto geography, we begin to ask deeper questions: Do the same ZIP codes show up across categories? Are these emergencies linked to social, economic, or environmental conditions?</p>
      <p>Let’s continue exploring and see what other insights we can uncover!</p>

      <h2>Zooming In: EMS and Fire Response by Precinct</h2>
      <p>While ZIP codes provide a neighborhood view, precinct-level analysis brings us even closer to operational realities. Police precincts — often used as administrative and deployment zones — reveal how emergency services are actually performing on the ground.</p>
      <iframe src="pages/bokeh_ems_precincts.html"></iframe>
      <iframe src="pages/bokeh_fire_precincts.html"></iframe>
      <p>Each of the interactive plots highlights critical insights about emergency response patterns by precinct. Each bar shows the total number of incidents for either EMS or Fire services. The  orange line represents the average response time in seconds. This is a crucial metric: longer response times can indicate areas where emergency services are overwhelmed or face local obstacles.</p>
      <p>Use the interactive features to explore individual boroughs and dive into specific police precincts by selecting only a few of them. You’ll be able to see how incident volume and response times vary across neighborhoods, often revealing surprising contrasts.You may find precincts where both EMS and Fire are responding to a high number of emergencies—yet response times remain high, indicating a shortage of ambulances, fire trucks, or available personnel. Alternatively, some areas with relatively low incident counts still show long response times, hinting at deeper inefficiencies—such as hard-to-reach neighborhoods, poor road access, or insufficient emergency resources.</p>
      <p>For example, some precincts in the Bronx report both high incident counts and slower response times. These may be densely populated neighborhoods, where heavy traffic, difficult terrain, or a high frequency of emergencies stretch local resources thin. In contrast, parts of Manhattan may show faster response times in areas with stronger infrastructure or more available units—although the borough's congestion and complexity can also lead to slower responses in certain pockets.</p>

      <h2>How Serious Are NYC Emergencies? A Closer Look at Severity Levels</h2>
      <p>Not all emergencies are created equal. Some are minor — a dizzy spell, a cut, a routine health issue. Others are life-threatening, with seconds making the difference between survival and loss.</p>
      <p>To better understand what first responders face, we categorized incidents by severity: Low, Moderate, High, or Extreme.</p>
      <div class="zoom-container">
        <img src="static/severity.png" alt="severity"/>
      <p>Both EMS and Fire services face an extraordinary demand each day. EMS, in particular, carries the brunt of the city's emergency load, with an overwhelming number of incidents spanning every severity level. From minor injuries to life-threatening cardiac arrests and trauma cases, the sheer volume handled by EMS is not just immense — it’s relentless. This constant pressure on the system can strain resources and highlight critical gaps in healthcare access and preventive care citywide.</p>
      <p>Fire Department responses are fewer in number but still shows a concerning trend. Too many of them are in Extreme severity level. These catastrophic events — such as building collapses or large-scale explosions — are happening more often than they should, demanding immediate, high-stakes coordination across multiple agencies. Both trends point to urgent questions about how the city allocates emergency resources, what risks are growing in our neighborhoods, and how prepared we truly are for the most serious events.</p>

      <h2>What Kind of Emergencies Are Happening Out There?<h2>
      <p>We’ve already uncovered where emergencies happen most and how quickly EMS and Fire teams respond. But to truly grasp the pulse of New York City’s emergency landscape, we need to ask a deeper question: What kind of crises are unfolding—and where?</p>
      <p>To answer that, we turned to detailed classifications from both EMS and Fire incident data, mapping them by police precinct and borough. The two interactive visualizations let us peel back the layers of emergency response in the city.</p>
      <iframe src="pages/bokeh_ems_categories.html"></iframe>
      <iframe src="pages/bokeh_fire_categories.html"></iframe>
      <p>With just a few clicks, you can explore specific types of emergencies—ranging from medical incidents like cardiac arrests, unconscious patients, and respiratory distress, or on the other plot fire-related events such as structural fires, hazardous materials, and automatic alarms. These are revealing not just where emergencies are occurring, but what’s actually happening in those moments of distress.</p>
      <p>Some precincts see sharp spikes in medical calls tied to substance use or respiratory issues, hinting at underlying health and social challenges. Meanwhile, certain neighborhoods show repeated fire activity—from structural blazes to gas leaks—suggesting places where infrastructure or housing quality may be in need of closer scrutiny.</p>
      <p>Color-coded bars offer another layer of insight, painting a borough-level picture at a glance. Brooklyn and the Bronx, in particular, emerge frequently in the higher ranges across both EMS and Fire categories. Whether this reflects higher population densities, socioeconomic factors, or environmental risks, it’s clear that some areas carry a heavier emergency burden than others.</p>
